Our program is about showing the temperature of a specific city in a fun and different way. We have used the API from openweathermap.org, where we implement the temperature from the page. When the temperature changes, the skirt of Beyonce becomes shorter (if the temperature rises) or longer (if the temperature lowers). Unfortunately the program doesn't work in the browser, and we haven't been able to figure out why this is, but it works in the atom-live-server. We used the API from openweathermap.org because it seemed like one of the simple sites to get an API from, and we found it difficult to find it on other pages (if we didn't want to pay for it at least). 


Our process of making the program was very much characterised by our wish to have fun with coding, and to make a program that wasn't too serious, but was still useful for the user. We found in the process that we understood some of the data, but that a lot of the data needs to be modified through different ways of coding - we for example had to convert the units of the temperature to regular degrees Celsius.


If I was to investigate web APIs further, I would definitely look more into why some APIs are open source and free for everyone to use, and others are not. I find it interesting, and would like to investigate some of the debates about the subject.
