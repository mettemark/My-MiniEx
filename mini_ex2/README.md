My program is an illustration of the difficulties a drunk person often faces when trying to text drunk. It illustrates the way the letters and words sometimes seems to "dance" over the screen of the phone. 
I have illustrated it on a simple iphone - simply because that is the phone i have, so that was the easiest to try to copy.
I have used many different syntaxes, and especially worked a lot with some basic shapes as rect and triangle. 
I have also looked a lot at basic functions such as stroke and colour to getting the phone to look as real as possible.
Besides this i have used the "random" function which i found very interesting to work with and trying to get to work the way i wanted it to.


I found this miniexercise very fun to make - both in relation to the which "fun" product to produce, but also in the process itself. I found it fun to work around with the small details and getting things to look the way I see them in my head. 
At some point I was frustrated because i wanted to "clone" the buttons with letters, so I wouldnt have to make 30 seperate buttons, and I couldn't get it to work. It made me very frustrated and almost sad, but when I finally i got it to work, I also find that I was very excited and happy. So in some way the more frustrated I get, the more "fun" I have in the end - given I get it to work.
