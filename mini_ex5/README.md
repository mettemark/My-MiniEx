For this week i have tried to create a simple game, where you are supposed to drop snowballs into a basket. Because I found it quite difficult to understand classes, arrays and so on, I have spent most of my time creating my object (snowball) and not much time on the game itself. But I did find that once the object was created, it was not that big a challenge to create the game. 

The object in itself looks very simple (a white ellipse), and it does not have a lot of attributes (colour, size and position), and it only has the method of moving randomly, to make it harder to get it in the basket. I have given it the attributes of size and colour to be able to play around with the looks of the snowball.

During my work with object-oriented programming I have gotten a deeper understanding of the meaning of this. I find class to be a way to create a sort of template and in this way being able to create several objects that have the same properties, but can vary in for example size, colour, placement etc.

If you look at my game in a cultural context, I think it symbolises the culture we live in now. It sometimes feels like it is all about being good at what you do, and not so much about having fun or learning something - in this way my "game" is only about being good at getting the balls into the basket. From a more abstract view the balls in my game also symbolises the way people are trying to fit into boxes, but are not completely able to control where they end up, and that people can end up in different places even though they have the same starting point.

I can think of many digital examples where operations and data are being abstracted and encapsulated. In almost every webpage where you need a user, you have to check different boxes and put in information about yourself where this data will in some way put you into boxes with other people even though you are very different from a lot of other viewpoints.
