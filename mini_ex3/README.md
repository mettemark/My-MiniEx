My  throbber is made up of arcs appearing next to each other in random colours. My program is relatively simple, and I played around with different shapes making the throbber (as you can see in line 22 and 23). For example I tried using small ellipses and squares, but in the end i decided on using the arc to create a more fluent and coherent expression. The time-related syntax/function I have used in my program is the frameCount which counts the total number of frames drawn from the beginning of the program. I played around with the speed of the throbber by changing the framerate and the parameter "num" in my function "drawThrobber". I found that the faster the throbber was drawn the more fluent it seemed to be. 

The reason why I ended up choosing the arc shape for my throbber is because I was inspired by the apple spinning rainbow wheel throbber. But instead of creating a classic "chronological" rainbow I have simply made the colours appear random. 

In general I think throbbers are a very simplified symbol of work in progress. The often very repetitive, monotous and uniform gives the user an impression of the same process happening even though this is often not the case. The throbber appears while many different tasks are performed "behind the scenes". The throbber also seems to rotate at the same speed and thus does not give a clear image of how fast the different tasks are being performed. Instead progress bars seems to give a much more clear image of the process - especially the ones that gives info about which specific task is being performed. The throbber should rather be seen as a message to the user that something is happening and that he/she should wait. 

During my work with throbbers it has become more clear to me how much a relatively small part of an interface can mean to the experience, and how much thought can be put into every single element of the throbber.
