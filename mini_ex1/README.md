**Thoughts about my first coding process**

My first coding process has been a lot of both ups and downs. I have found it very motivating, fun and exciting when I see the code, I have written, working. I have also found it very frustrating when the code I have written isn't working - often because of just one missing character. This is where I think coding challenges me the most, because you have to be very precise in your writing. But I also find this precision of code very fascinating, and the fact that you can see exactly what you have created immediately after coding it. 
I find that coding is almost a new way of thinking about and imagining things, and I was very inspired simply by the codes I found in "references" on p5js.org. As I am very inexperienced in the coding language, I found that simply exploring the different examples expanded my horizon enormously and increased my creativity.
I tried working with some moving 3D figures, but found that I then lacked some background knowledge when trying to change and adjust these. Therefore, I decided on "going back" a step in the complication level of my code and settled on a simpler 2D program. My program is inspired by some of the videos we have watched for class, where a sort of simple Paint program is made.
