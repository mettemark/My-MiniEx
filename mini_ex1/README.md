**Thoughts about my first independent coding process**
My first coding process has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride - a lot of ups and downs

Describe your first independent coding process (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing, uploading, sharing, commenting code)
How your coding process is differ or similar to reading and writing text? (You may also reflect upon Annette Vee's text on coding literacy)
What might be the potential and possibility of coding practice?
