Our project consists of 7 lines from the song "Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts" by Funkadelic. These 7 lines are first shown in the order they are originally written, but if the user presses the mouse, the lines are rearranged in a different order. Besides the rearrangement the program will also play a soundfile of a person asking the question "dig it?". This is to underline how big a difference the order of lines in a song, poem or another text is. It is in this way made clear that the user has a new reason to reflect on the lyric even though all the lines are the same. 

Besides the external expression of the program, we have worked a lot with the code itself. We have for example named a variable containing the textfile "dont_worry" because this is one of the messages we get from reading and listening to the song "Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts", and something we wanted to pass on to the reader of the code. 
We have tried using the visual expression of the code as well. Again this was to underline some of the message we really wanted the reader to notice, line 14: "var dont_worry; // Free your mind and your ass will follow".
We have also tried to mirror the way the user is asked if he/she digs it in the middle of the code (line 48) by adding a question for the reader as a comment. In this way the reader will hopefully again reflect on the previous lines and if he agrees or not, or simply if he digs it. 

In relation to the text "Vocable Code", I find it interesting to look at how our code says so much more, and gives a different message if a person reads it rather than just look at the program. Some of the message is not delivered to the user unless he/she looks closer at the code behind the program. In this way we are entirely writing the code for the reader and not the computer, and in some way we underline the fact that computers do not have the ability to reflect upon things the way humans do.
