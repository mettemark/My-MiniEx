The rules of my program are pretty simple; either a rectangle or an ellipse is drawn, or the background is changed. Which one of the actions are performed depends on a random number from 0 to 1. I have set the sizes and colours of the shapes to be partly random, but I have made sure the ellipses are almost always smaller than the rectangles to create the idea of an eye appearing inside a box. This is underlined with the text "All eyes on YOU". The text to me seems a bit threatening, and the bright colours of the shapes are in contrast with this. 
I have made sure a new background is sometimes generated in the program. This is to create the idea of a new eye being drawn on a new background/canvas. Again this is to underline several eyes being on the user. 
I found this mini ex to be very difficult and challenging, and even though my program is simple, I find that I personally have a deeper understanding of what generativity is and can be - my ability to create generativity through coding is a whole different thing though. I have looked at many examples of generativity, and find these very interesting and many of them I can keep on looking at for a long time, as they are indeed generative. By the term generativity I understand something that changes through time, and these changes are in some way not possible to foresee, but as an artist you affect them, or create the generativity.
