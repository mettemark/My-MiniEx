**Thoughts about the process**


The difficulty in drawing the flowchart was for me to figure out which steps were important for me to go in detail with. I especially thought a lot about the part with the API - it is of course a bit complex, and therefore I did cinsider writing more steps about the API into the code (such as 'define API key'). In the end i decided on not to describe the API in detail, as I found it did not mean a lot for the understanding of the project as a whole.
