For this miniEx I wanted to do something a bit critical of society. I have used some syntaxes from the p5.dom library to create a button, and played around with the looks of the button to make it resemble a record button. I have also worked on a kind of throbber that varies in the alpha-value. This was actually the part of my code that caused me the biggest difficulties, so I had to get a lot of help creating it. 

My program technically captures both when the mouse is pressed on a button and when the spacebar is pressed. When the button is pressed, a red throbber appears in the top left corner along with the text "recordingâ€¦". This is to symbolise that something is being recorded - it is not defined if this is sound, video, mouse movement or something else. When the user then tries to stop the recording by pressing the spacebar, the recording continues. 

With the program I try to underline how much we are being monitored and how much data is being collected about us, without us being able to do anything about it.  

Overall this miniEx has made me think a lot more about data capturing in our society, and I am already noticing and reflecting a lot more on for example what kind of adds are offered to me on Facebook, Instagram etc. Even though my program criticizes the constant data capturing we are exposed to I have also reflected a lot upon the positive effects of it, and find it to be something that isn't just loss of freedom, but also something that can be helpful as regards to safety and for everyone in our everyday lives.
